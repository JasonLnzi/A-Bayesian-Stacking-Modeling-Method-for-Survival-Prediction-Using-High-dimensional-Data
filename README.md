We introduced a novel survival stacking method that modeled using group structure information to improve the robustness of cancer survival prediction in the context of high-dimensional omics data. With a super learner, survival stacking combines the prediction from multiple sub-models that are independently trained using the features in pre-grouped sub-data. In addition to a non-negative linear combination of sub-models, we extended the super learner to non-negative Bayesian hierarchical generalized linear model.
